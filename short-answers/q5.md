# Question
What are the two arguments that we pass into `fetch` and what do they do? What does `fetch` return?

# Answer
The two arguments are `fetch(resource, options)`. `resource` is a relative or absolute URL of the resource you want to fetch. `optional` is an object containing options for the request, such as method (GET, POST, etc.), headers, body, mode, cache, credentials, etc. The `fetch` returns a Promise that resolves to the Response object representing the response to the request. The Response object contains methods for handling the response data. Ex. `.then()` or `.catch()`.
