# Question
`fetch` returns a promise of the `Response` object. It has a lot of useful properties on it. Can you explain what each of these properties are for?

- `Response.ok`
- `Response.status`
- `Response.url`
- `Response.headers`

# Answer

1. `Response.ok` - This is the boolean whether the response was successful or not. True for successful and vice versa.

2. `Response.status` - This is the HTTP status code of the response, which is information of the outcome response to a client's request sent by the server.

3. `Response.url` - This the URL of the response. It good for when the request was redirected, as it gives you the final URL of the resource.

4. `Response.headers` - This gives the Headers object representing the response headers associated with the request. Methods like .get(), .has(), or .forEach() can be use on Headers object to access and manipulate the response headers.

These are getting the property of the response object.
