# Question
Please define what each HTTP verb does. Then, provide an example of when you would use it.

- GET
- POST
- PUT/PATCH
- DELETE

# Answer
1. GET - is used to request data from a specified resource. 
Ex. It's like the request to the server to fetch the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files required to display the webpage when opening a link.

2. POST - is used to submit data to be processed to a specified resource.
Ex. The data that the client submits. The server then processes this data bc of this post request, for example, by storing it in a database.

3. PUT/PATCH - is used to update, PUT typically replaces the entire resource with the new data provided, while PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to the resource.
Ex. Suppose you have a database of users, and to update a user's information. you could use PUT, you would send a request with the entire updated user object to replace the existing user resource. But with PATCH, you would send a request with only the fields you want to update, leaving the rest unchanged.

4. DELETE - is used to delete a specified resource.
Ex. A delete request is sent to delete a post on social media. The server then processes this request by deleting the specified post from the database.
